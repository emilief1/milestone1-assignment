      <h3> What Are The Most Popular Web Browsers Now? </h3>
      <p>
        The most popular web browsers currently are chrome, safari and Microsoft edge. </p>
      <p>
        The Backlinko team has stated that, “Chrome remains the #1 most-used browser on mobile and desktop. Safari, largely thanks to being the default browser
        on iOS devices, comes in at a relatively close second” (Backlinko). Other browsers such as Firefox and Opera are still in use today but, compared to Chrome and 
        Safari they are not as greatly favored.
      </p>  
        During the creation of web browsers, there was a fight between developers. This is referred to as “The Browser Wars” and this occurred in 1995. 
        Netscape and Microsoft worked hard to best eachother. This war started because Microsoft licensed the other Mosaic code and then built off of it.
      </p>
       <p> Browser wars played a big part in making companies more popular and making better browsers.</p>
