      <h3> The History of Web Browsers </h3> 
      <p>
        Web browsers are a lot newer than most people probably think they are. A scientist by the name of Tim Berners-Lee was the first person
         to make a web browser.Berners-Lee was able to create a user-friendly interface in 1990; and he named it the “WorldWideWeb”. </p>
       <p> Once the "worldWideWeb" became as popular as it did, many other companies decided to test their luck with it as well.</p>
      <p>    
         The next, to create one that became popular was at the University of Illinois. "Mosaic" was developed in 1993 by The National Centre for Supercomputing 
         Applications. The reason that with became as favored as it did was because it allowed the use of images on the web. by 1994 a new browser was released 
         by Andreessen and it was called "Netscape". By 1995 Microsoft developed one of their own. </p>
      <p> 
        With the release of “Internet Explorer” it started something called the browser wars. This was a fight between the main companies creating web browsers 
        to see who could develop a better, faster and more appealing web browser. While this was occuring the browers released were Opera by Opera, "Mozilla" by Netscape 
        in 1998, the open source code allowed for Mozilla Firefox to be developed later, the next development for browser after Firefox was in 2003.
      </p>   
      <p>  
         Apple released “Safari” which was made for Macintosh operating system. A well known browser that is still widely used today is "Google Chrome" 
         and it was launched in 2008. In 2015 “Microsoft Edge” was released and it was an upgraded version on "Internet Explore". There are many other browsers that were 
         developed in the time talked about but, were not as popular. The Browsers that impacted history a lot were "Moscaic", "WorldWideWeb" and a few other, these browsers 
         laid the foundation on the development of browsers.
